# Tree identical

The tree `is_dentical` function checks if the current tree is identical to another tree that is
being passed in as input.

If both trees root's values match - then it proceeds to check whether or not left and right subtree-s are also identical or not. This is done recursively.

### Following is the definition:

```rust,ignore
//Is this tree is identical to other tree?
    pub fn is_identical(&self, other: &Self) -> bool {
        match self.0 {
            Some(ref this) => match other {
                Tree(Some(ref that)) => {
                    if this.borrow().key == that.borrow().key {
                        let this_left = &this.borrow().left;
                        let that_left = &that.borrow().left;
                        let this_right = &this.borrow().right;
                        let that_right = &that.borrow().right;
                        let left_matched = match this_left {
                            Some(ref this_tree) => match that_left {
                                Some(ref that_tree) => {
                                    return Self::is_identical(
                                        &this_tree.borrow(),
                                        &that_tree.borrow(),
                                    );
                                }
                                None => false,
                            },
                            None => that_left.is_none(),
                        };
                        let right_matched = match this_right {
                            Some(ref this_tree) => match that_right {
                                Some(ref that_tree) => {
                                    return Self::is_identical(
                                        &this_tree.borrow(),
                                        &that_tree.borrow(),
                                    );
                                }
                                None => false,
                            },
                            None => that_right.is_none(),
                        };
                        left_matched && right_matched
                    } else {
                        false
                    }
                }
                Tree(None) => false,
            },

            None => match other {
                Tree(Some(_)) => false,
                Tree(None) => true,
            },
